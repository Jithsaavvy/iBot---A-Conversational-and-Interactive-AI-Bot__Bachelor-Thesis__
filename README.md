Intelligent Bot [iBot] is a programmed application that performs an automated task in a conversational format. It is similar to that of chatbots available now a days. It is facilitated by Microsoft Bot Framework that consists of Bot Builder SDK,  Bot Connector, Bot Emulator. Language Understanding Intelligent Systems (LUIS) is incorporated for natural language processing [NLP] to give the bot more human like senses. Cognitive Services are APIâ€™s that provides an efficient way for the bot to be more interactive and better user experience. REST API is used to host the bot into an app or a website by returning JSON objects and the bot is programmed by C# & .NET libraries. 

iBot was developed using supervised learning [ML Paradigm] and Natural Language Processing [NLP] along with computer vision like face detection ,emotion detection, predicting captions. 

# Existing System: 
In Existing System, Bots are currently emerging technologies. Chatbots like ELIZA, ALICE uses only some predefined commands . 
# Disadvantages of existing system: 
- Existing bots only produces result only according to predefined rules. 
- They does not have the ability to learn and interact like humans. 
- Existing bots are less intelligent. 

# Proposed System: 
To nullify the demerits of existing bots, we can upgrade the bots to be more interactive by providing additional intelligence. Now a days since AI and ML are getting more attention, those highly powerful concepts and paradigms can be applied to improve the intelligence of the bot and make it more interactive.
# Advantages of proposed system: 
- The  main  objective  of  this  is  to  provide  intelligence to make the bots interactive . 
- Language models can be incorporated to achieve Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
- Cognitive services like face detection , emotion detection etc can be added to the bots .
